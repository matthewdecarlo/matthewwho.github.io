		                <h2>Classes V. IDs. October 7th 2014</h2>

						<h3>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3>
						<p>It all boils down to the fact that classes are NOT unique and IDs are.  This allows for similar classes to be treated the same and different, unique IDs to be treated, well uniquely!</p>

		                <h2>Thoughts Regarding the Fireside Chat. October 7th 2014</h2>

						<h3>Prompt:</h3>
						<p>What's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>

						<h3>Answer:</h3>
						<p>This is an opinion, based upon the [Fireside Chat with Shereef](http://vimeo.com/85001014).  DBC is dynamic, always changing  — a grand experiment.  It is a safe-haven to challenge yourself.  I am excited at the chance to challenge myself and embracing the creator mindset, ‘this is my program, my nine weeks.’  If anything, after watching this chat my expectations are higher for DBC.  I am very inspired to work together with my cohort and make something memorable!  Having watched the chat in its entirety, I can confidently say my nerves have been calmed.</p>

						<h1>N00b a First Post</h1>
		                <h2>matthewwho - blog (Technical Blog)</h2>
		                <h2>Answering some Git/ GitHub Version Control n00b questions. October 7th 2014</h2>

						<h3>* What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
						<p>Using a Version control (system) is like having a crew of personal assistants who meticulously organize and catalog all of your updates/ changes to your project.  Best of all with a open source version control system like git -- you get those amazing assistants for free!</p>

						<h3>* How does Git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
						<p>Remember that crew of assistants mentioned above?  Well, Git works efficiently and tirelessly to make sure that everything is organize and cataloged for you.  As long as you give Git a memo about the changes you made when committing them, Git will make it easy for you to sort though the backlog of versions/ changes.</p>

						<h3>* Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
						<p>GitHub is the Grand Central Station of version control repositories.   That is, if Grand Central let you ride the trains for free if you promised to share everything you brought with you on the train with your fellow commuters.  GitHub is a social sharing website, where members can access it for free and share their code openly.  For a small fee you can choose to be antisocial or even start you own secret elite club.</p>

						<p>Note: N00b is internet slang for someone who is new to a topic or skill set.</p>
