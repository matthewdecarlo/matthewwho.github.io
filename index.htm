						<h1>Thinking Styles and Learning</h1>
		                <h2>matthewwho - blog (Cutural Blog)</h2>
		                <h2>Thinking and Learning October 26th 2014</h2>

						<p>We were asked to take the <a href=“http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm”>Gregorc Thinking Style</a>, personal thinking style <a href=“http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html”>quiz</a>.  My results were enlightening as I found out that I am more of a Concrete Random, Abstract Random, Abstract Sequential kinda guy.  Basically that means that my mind is amazing and that scientist will be studying it for ages!</p>

						<p>In all seriousness this insight has allowed me to better understand how to optimize my learning experience.  For example using my five senses is a great way to help me learn more quickly.  This is why I like to use a whiteboard to write out ideas and play with them in a more physical/ material way.</p>

						<p>In regards to a <a href=“http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/”>growth vs. fixed mindset</a>, I feel that I have in the past and will continue to embrace the growth mindset.  It is quite enjoyable to embrace a challenge, struggle with a difficult concept, and overcome the challenge.  This is how we achieve a new skill set.</p>

						<h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
		                <h2>matthewwho - blog (Technical Blog)</h2>
		                <h2>Arrays v. Hashes October 25th 2014</h2>

						<h3>Why use one over the other?</h3>
						<p>Many times a hash can more accurate than an array. The use of compound keys (or hash of hashes) can be used to simulate multidimensional arrays. Hashes are easier for these cases and for that reason are extreamly common.</p>

						<p>However, hashes aren't ordered, 1,2,3. While it is very easy to put the data into a hash, it becomes more complicated to get it back out in an ordered way. Much more complicated than just using an array in the first place.</p>

			                <h2>Classes V. IDs. October 7th 2014</h2>

							<h3>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3>
							<p>It all boils down to the fact that classes are NOT unique and IDs are.  This allows for similar classes to be treated the same and different, unique IDs to be treated, well uniquely!</p>

			                <h2>Thoughts Regarding the Fireside Chat. October 7th 2014</h2>

							<h3>Prompt:</h3>
							<p>What's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>

							<h3>Answer:</h3>
							<p>This is an opinion, based upon the [Fireside Chat with Shereef](http://vimeo.com/85001014).  DBC is dynamic, always changing  — a grand experiment.  It is a safe-haven to challenge yourself.  I am excited at the chance to challenge myself and embracing the creator mindset, ‘this is my program, my nine weeks.’  If anything, after watching this chat my expectations are higher for DBC.  I am very inspired to work together with my cohort and make something memorable!  Having watched the chat in its entirety, I can confidently say my nerves have been calmed.</p>

							<h1>N00b a First Post</h1>
			                <h2>matthewwho - blog (Technical Blog)</h2>
			                <h2>Answering some Git/ GitHub Version Control n00b questions. October 7th 2014</h2>

							<h3>* What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
							<p>Using a Version control (system) is like having a crew of personal assistants who meticulously organize and catalog all of your updates/ changes to your project.  Best of all with a open source version control system like git -- you get those amazing assistants for free!</p>

							<h3>* How does Git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
							<p>Remember that crew of assistants mentioned above?  Well, Git works efficiently and tirelessly to make sure that everything is organize and cataloged for you.  As long as you give Git a memo about the changes you made when committing them, Git will make it easy for you to sort though the backlog of versions/ changes.</p>

							<h3>* Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
							<p>GitHub is the Grand Central Station of version control repositories.   That is, if Grand Central let you ride the trains for free if you promised to share everything you brought with you on the train with your fellow commuters.  GitHub is a social sharing website, where members can access it for free and share their code openly.  For a small fee you can choose to be antisocial or even start you own secret elite club.</p>

							<p>Note: N00b is internet slang for someone who is new to a topic or skill set.</p>
