Prompt:
What's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

Answer:
This is an opinion, based upon the [Fireside Chat with Shereef](http://vimeo.com/85001014).  DBC is dynamic, always changing  — a grand experiment.  It is a safe-haven to challenge yourself.  I am excited at the chance to challenge myself and embracing the creator mindset, ‘this is my program, my nine weeks.’  If anything, after watching this chat my expectations are higher for DBC.  I am very inspired to work together with my cohort and make something memorable!  Having watched the chat in its entirety, I can confidently say my nerves have been calmed.
